The top priority is to bring the branching strategy out to the client, so that we can put this into practise
, ASAP.

So the whole idea about the meeting I had with the client was to train them about the multi-tenancy stuff. So at the moment the client has got many vendors. All the vendors are building the website at the same time. Now the challenge is every code *project* built by the vendors has to *be* merged into one branch, the primary branch. very difficult to get the code only relevent to go into prod*.* this is one of the challenge and I came up with a branching stategy and then I propose the strategy to the client.  The strategy was more about haveing the vendor specific branches where they built their own code commit to vendor specific branch
